# CS-300

## Data Structures and Algorithms: Analysis and Design
Welcome to the CS 300 repository! This repository contains the work I completed as part of my CS 300 course at Southern New Hampshire University. Throughout this course, I developed code and pseudocode to solve algorithmic problems, applied advanced data structures, and focused on designing efficient, readable, and maintainable software. This course emphasized both non-coding development methodologies and practical implementation through structured projects.

## About the course
CS 300 is a 300-level course focused on the analysis and design of data structures and algorithms. The course explores non-coding methodologies (like pseudocode planning) and challenges students to develop optimized code for real-world applications. Key concepts include:

- Algorithmic Design and Problem Solving
- Advanced Data Structures (Vectors, Hash Tables, Binary Search Trees)
- Runtime and Memory Analysis
- Pseudocode Planning and Translation into Code

  ## What You'll Find Here

This repository contains two major project components, each aligned with specific course competencies.

ðŸ”¹ Project One â€“ Pseudocode Development (Module Six Submission)
Created pseudocode to design and outline a program for ABC University. The pseudocode included:
- A menu-driven program structure
- Data loading logic from a CSV file
- Data storage using a Binary Search Tree
- Sorting and display logic for course data in alphanumeric order
- A search feature to retrieve course details and prerequisites
It also includes a runtime and memory analysis of each data structure used: vector, hash table, and binary search tree.

ðŸ”¹ Project Two â€“ Code Implementation (Module Seven Submission)
Wrote and implemented C++ code based on the pseudocode from Project One. This working program allows users to:
- Load and parse course data from a CSV file
- Store and organize data in a binary search tree
- Print all courses in alphanumeric order
- Search for a specific course and view its prerequisites

Reflection
This section answers the required reflection questions outlined in the course journal assignment.

## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The goal was to create a course advising program that allows students to load, view, and search course information for ABC University. The key challenge was organizing and displaying course data with proper handling of prerequisites using effective data structures.

## How did you approach the problem?
I began by outlining the logical flow of the program using pseudocode, considering how each data structure would impact performance and functionality. I chose a binary search tree for alphanumeric sorting and quick retrieval, ensuring the course list could be efficiently searched and displayed.

## How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
One challenge was validating user input and preventing runtime errors during data loading. I handled this by implementing error checking and using helper functions to sanitize input. Debug print statements also helped verify that data loaded correctly into the BST.

## How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This project reinforced the importance of planning before coding. Writing detailed pseudocode helped prevent logic errors during implementation. It also highlighted the significance of selecting the right data structure for the problem at hand, not just using whatâ€™s familiar.

## How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I put extra focus on clean, modular code with meaningful comments and helpful prompts. My goal was to make the program user-friendly while ensuring the codebase could be easily updated or expandedâ€”whether by me or another developer in the future.

## Why This Project Matters
This project showcases my ability to design software using algorithmic thinking and apply data structures to solve practical problems. It reflects my growth in evaluating performance trade-offs and building programs that are not just functional but scalable and maintainable.

## Future Applications
The techniques practiced hereâ€”especially pseudocode planning, tree-based storage, and sorting algorithmsâ€”will be valuable in fields ranging from backend development to systems programming and technical interviews.

Thank you for visiting this repository! I hope it offers a clear view of my growth as a software developer and problem solver.
